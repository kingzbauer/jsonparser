## JSON parser

It's been a while since I built/worked on a Parser or Interpreter. This is an ongoing hobby project to explore a bit of parsing refresher.

Think of a tool like `jq`. This is essentially an experiement to see if I can improve on the execution speed of `jq` by creating a JSON parser from ground up.

Something almost in the vein of https://github.com/tidwall/gjson.

Stay tuned. I'll be updating this as I get time to hack on it.
